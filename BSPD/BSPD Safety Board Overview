The Brake System Plausibility Device (BSPD) Board is a critical component in an FSAE car's electrical and safety system. Here's an overview of the BSPD Board:

Safety Assurance: The BSPD Board is a safety-critical device designed to ensure that the car's brakes are functioning correctly. It's a fundamental element in maintaining the safety of both the driver and the vehicle during testing and competitions.

Non-Programmable Logic: The BSPD Board operates on non-programmable logic, meaning it functions are based on a fixed set of rules and it does not rely on any software or user-defined settings. This characteristic enhances its reliability and minimizes the potential for errors.

Anomaly Detection: It continuously monitors the behavior of the brake system for any anomalies or irregularities. This includes factors like brake pressure and pedal position. If the BSPD detects any issues, it triggers predefined safety protocols.

Safety Response: When the BSPD detects a brake system malfunction or failure, it takes immediate safety actions. These actions can include cutting power to the engine and warning the driver of a problem.

Compliance and Regulations: The design and functionality of the BSPD Board must adhere to specific safety regulations and standards. This is essential for participating in FSAE competitions and ensuring the car's compliance with safety rules.

In summary, the BSPD Board is a non-programmable safety mechanism that plays a vital role in monitoring and ensuring the proper operation of the braking system in an FSAE car. Its primary objective is to maintain safety by detecting and responding to brake system anomalies.
