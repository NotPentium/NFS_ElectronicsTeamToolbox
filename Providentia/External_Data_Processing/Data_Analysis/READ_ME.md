This code aims to convert raw data from all sensors into graphs, enabling the comparison and analysis of the performance of both the car and the driver. Additional functionalities of the code include indicating the average, maximum, and minimum wheel speed (at the back of the vehicle), displaying the average positions of the accelerator and brake, indicating the average steering wheel angle, and providing the maximum and minimum values for acceleration in all three axes measured by the BOSCH accelerometer (reference) and the result from the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The latter allows for a minor debugging capability, enabling the analysis of differences in acceleration resulting from these two methods. To enhance the reliability of the car's acceleration, the quadratic error between the acceleration measured by the BOSCH accelerometer (reference) and that resulting from the EKF is calculated. If this difference exceeds a given threshold, the EKF data should be disregarded, and only the BOSCH sensor data should be used.

An example would be the comparison... [provide specific example if applicable].
