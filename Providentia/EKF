this section of the Providentia Project is being worked on!

Extended Kalman Filter theory:

https://www.mathworks.com/help/driving/ug/extended-kalman-filters.html (also has valuable information for implemantation of this filter on MATLAB.)
https://www.mathworks.com/help/control/ref/ekf_block.html (info about implementation on simulink!! -> has a excelent example for a EKF/UEKF for multiple sensors: https://www.mathworks.com/help/control/ug/multirate-nonlinear-state-estimation-in-simulink.html)

EKF possible improvements:
