The files EKF.c and EKF.h constitute the library that performs the Extended Kalman Filter operations based on the 9 inputs from respective sensors. The output (acceleration) of this library is in the form of pitch, yaw, and roll. Therefore, in the main.c file, it was necessary to transform these values into Cartesian coordinates using a rotation matrix. The other two files, testDataset.txt and EKF_outputC.txt, correspond to the database with the sensor outputs and the final result of the EKF, respectively.
