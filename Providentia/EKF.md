# Non-linear Kalman Filter Research Repository for the Providentia Project

Welcome to our Kalman Filter research repository for the Data Acquisition (DAQ) project for the NOVA FS team. 
This repository serves as a centralized resource to share and document all links explored during our research phase. 
Our goal is to provide transparency and understanding of the work conducted by our team.

## Scope

This repository includes links related to the Kalman Filter of the DAQ project. 
The content spans various categories such as research papers, hardware documentation, software documentation, forums, and discussions.

## Published Links and Descriptions

### 1. Extended Kalman Filter Theory:
