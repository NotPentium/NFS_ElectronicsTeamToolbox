this section of the Providentia Project is being worked on!

Extended Kalman Filter theory:
(EKF Wikipedia)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Kalman_filter]
(EKF Mathworks)[https://www.mathworks.com/help/driving/ug/extended-kalman-filters.html] -> (also has valuable information for implemantation of this filter on MATLAB.)
(EKF Mathworks 2)[https://www.mathworks.com/help/control/ref/ekf_block.html] -> (also has info about implementation on simulink -> (excelent example for a EKF/UEKF for multiple sensors)[https://www.mathworks.com/help/control/ug/multirate-nonlinear-state-estimation-in-simulink.html]
