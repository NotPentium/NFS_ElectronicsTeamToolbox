# Providentia Library

Welcome to the Providentia Project library! 
This library serves as a centralized repository for various documents related to our project. 

The Providentia Project is designed to capture data from multiple sensors, process it using a microcontroller, and store the results on a micro SD card. To achieve this we created two different boards: a main board, named Providentia, where the data from the sensors is received, processed and stored in the microSD, a data aquisition board (DAQ), named Valkyrie, incorporating almost all the sensors.

## Project Overview

Our Providentia Project encompasses the following key components:

### Sensors

- **Accelerometer:** Measures acceleration forces, providing crucial data for motion and orientation analysis.
- **Gyroscope:** Captures angular velocity, aiding in tracking rotation and orientation changes.
- **Temperature Sensor:** Monitors the temperature, providing environmental data for analysis.

### Microcontroller

The microcontroller processes data from the sensors, enabling real-time analysis and decision-making. It plays a central role in the functionality of the DAQ board.

### Micro SD Card Reader/Writer

To facilitate data storage, the DAQ board is equipped with a micro SD card reader/writer. This component allows for efficient and convenient storage of acquired data.

## Library Structure

Explore the subfolders to access relevant documentation for different aspects of the DAQ project:

- **USB:** [File](./USB.md)
- **EKF:** [File](./EKF.md)

Feel free to contribute to the library by adding new documents or updating existing ones.

## Getting Started

For information on setting up and using the DAQ board, please refer to the relevant documentation in the subfolders.

## Contact

For questions or collaboration opportunities, please reach out to [RobertoERT or NotPentium] at [re.teixeira@campus.fct.unl.pt or pav.fernandes@campus.fct.unl.pt].

We hope this library proves valuable in understanding the DAQ project!
