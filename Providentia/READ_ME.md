# DAQ Library

Welcome to the DAQ (Data Acquisition) library! 
This library serves as a centralized repository for various documents related to our DAQ acquisition board project. 
The DAQ board is designed to capture data from multiple sensors, process it using a microcontroller, and store the results on a micro SD card.

## Project Overview

Our DAQ acquisition board project encompasses the following key components:

### Sensors

- **Accelerometer:** Measures acceleration forces, providing crucial data for motion and orientation analysis.
- **Gyroscope:** Captures angular velocity, aiding in tracking rotation and orientation changes.
- **Temperature Sensor:** Monitors the temperature, providing environmental data for analysis.

### Microcontroller

The microcontroller processes data from the sensors, enabling real-time analysis and decision-making. It plays a central role in the functionality of the DAQ board.

### Micro SD Card Reader/Writer

To facilitate data storage, the DAQ board is equipped with a micro SD card reader/writer. This component allows for efficient and convenient storage of acquired data.
