# Negative-Resistance Oscillator Principles

## Oscillation Loop Components

An oscillation loop consists of two branches:

### Active Branch

The active branch, composed of the oscillator, initiates and builds up the oscillation until it stabilizes. It compensates for losses in the passive branch.

### Passive Branch

The passive branch includes the resonator, two load capacitors (CL1 and CL2), and parasitic capacitances.

## Biasing and Transconductance

When the oscillator is correctly biased, the transconductance of the oscillator must equal the conductance of the passive branch to maintain stable oscillation.

During startup, the oscillator's transconductance must be higher than the passive branch's conductance to facilitate oscillation buildup. Excessive transconductance can lead to saturation and startup failure.

To ensure successful startup:
- The ratio of negative resistance to crystal maximal equivalent series resistance should be > 5 for HSE oscillators and > 3 for LSE oscillators.

# Pierce Oscillators

## Load Capacitance

Load capacitance (CL) is determined by external capacitors (CL1 and CL2) and stray capacitance (Cs). Frequency accuracy requires matching the crystal's load capacitance, which can be tuned using CL1 and CL2.

## Oscillator Transconductance and Gain Margin

The oscillator must provide sufficient gain for stable oscillation buildup. The gain margin ratio (gainmargin) is crucial. Ensure:
- Gm_crit_max > gmcrit
- gainmargin > 5

Formulas:
- gainmargin = gm / gmcrit
- gmcrit is computed from passive components parameters, assuming CL1=CL2.

# Drive Level

The power dissipated in the crystal, known as the drive level, must be limited to avoid crystal failure due to excessive mechanical vibrations. The maximum drive level is specified by the crystal manufacturer.

Formula for drive level: [ins EQ], where IQ is the current flowing through the crystal in RMS.

# External Resistor

The external resistor (RExt) limits the crystal's drive level, forming a low-pass filter with CL2. RExt is calculated as the reactance of CL2. Recalculate gain margin after determining RExt.

# Startup Time

The time required for oscillation to start and stabilize depends on components like CL1, CL2, and ESR. Higher crystal nominal frequency lowers startup time.

Common startup problems arise from improperly dimensioned gain margin, CL1 and CL2 size, or high ESR.
