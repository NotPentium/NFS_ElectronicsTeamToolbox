The ADXL313 stands out as a high-resolution 3-axis accelerometer, offering precise 13-bit measurements within a range of Â±4 g. Its digital output data is conveniently formatted as 16-bit twos complement, accessible through the I2C digital interface. This feature-rich sensor is particularly well-suited for black box applications, excelling in measuring both static acceleration due to gravity in tilt-sensing scenarios and dynamic acceleration resulting from motion or shock.

To ensure accuracy, the ADXL313 has been optimized for a **measuring range between -2g and 2g**, boasting a mere **0.5% nonlinearity over the Full Scale Span (FSS)**. Additionally, it exhibits a **1% cross-axis sensitivity**. The sensor's **sensitivity** is impressive, measuring at **0.97mg at 12 bits and 3.9mg at 10 bits**.

In terms of calibration and stability, the ADXL313 demonstrates a **Zero-G offset of less than 75mg in each axis**, coupled with a minimal **Zero-G drift of less than 200mg** over the entire operational temperature range. This ensures reliable and consistent performance across varying environmental conditions.

The accelerometer offers a versatile **bandwidth**, ranging from **6.25Hz to 3.2kHz**, allowing for flexibility in capturing a broad spectrum of accelerations. Its power requirements are moderate, with a supply voltage ranging from 2V to 3.6V and an IO voltage of 1.7V, making it compatible with a variety of systems. The sensor operates with a **supply current of approximately 170uA**, assuming a 200Hz sampling frequency, balancing efficient power usage with responsive data acquisition.

With these specifications, **the ADXL313 emerges as a robust and reliable choice for applications demanding precise and versatile acceleration measurements**, making it an ideal component for the Valkyrie Board.
