Introducing the Valkyrie Board, a meticulously crafted sensor module tailored to capture and analyze the dynamic experiences of our FS car. This versatile board excels in recording data from a variety of sensors, seamlessly transmitting it via CAN communication to the data acquisition board. The Valkyrie diligently captures information from surface-mounted accelerometers, gyroscopes, GPS receivers, and magnetometers.

By harnessing the collective power of these sensors and employing robust sensor fusion techniques, the Valkyrie enables precise measurements of the car's position, velocity, acceleration, and heading across all three axes. This sophisticated integration of sensors and fusion technologies enhances our ability to gain accurate insights into the vehicle's dynamic behavior.
